## Get Started 

Please head to the [Carbon LDP™ Quick Start Guide](https://carbonldp.com/documentation/v5.x.x/quick-start-guide/)  and start using Carbon LDP™ . 

## Configuration on Carbon LDP Platform Instances
In order to get more information on how to configure your Carbon LDP's Platform instances head to our website where you will find detailed information on how to setup and configure your [Carbon LDP Platform](https://carbonldp.com/documentation/v5.x.x/platform/configuration/). 

## REST API 
The REST API provides a way for applications to interact with the Carbon LDP™ platform using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and resources identified by URIs.

The Carbon Platform is a RESTful API which can be accessed by REST methods for mor information we have created a Postman Collection with all the examples featured in our documentation. Feel free to [import it](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/307f7898c630698ce5a8) and try all the examples yourself.

This is a lower-level API than a Software Developing Kit (SDK) and doing things directly with the REST API is generally more tedious than with an SDK. However, understanding the REST API provides insight into how the platform works and can be advantageous in certain scenarios. Please head to the REST API Documentation provided in out [website](https://carbonldp.com/documentation/v5.x.x/rest-api/) for more.
